        \n I am broadly interested in data science and artificial intelligence with a focus on health informatics and machine learning. In particular, I am interested in automated machine learning, trustworthy multimodal large language models. \
        \n Currently, I am working on projects related to trustworthy Medical Large Vision Language Models (Med-LVLMs), particularly focusing on hallucinations in these models. \
        \n I enjoy spotting and sovling problems by learning new skills:\
        \n- **Programming Language** --- Python, Java\
        \n- **Web Based Language & Framework**  --- HTML, JavaScript, CSS, Vue.js, Node.js, tornado, flask\
        \n- **DB** --- MySQL, MongoDB, Redis\
